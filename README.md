# About Us

Our mission is to bring the smog back to Denver. The sun is a nuisance that
that needs to be eliminated. We are watching in terror as our precious city is invaded
by sun-seekers.

This was a project created for Name.com's two hour [Hack the Dot](https://www.name.com/hackthedot) hackathon. The theme of this hackathon was the domain name "Denver.cloud". This project was a fun exercise in teamwork, creativity, and time management. In case it isn't obvious, this is a silly, fun projectâ€“ we in no way support the pollution of the atmosphere. The [Climate & Clean Air Coalition](http://www.ccacoalition.org/en) is doing great work to unite governments worldwide in a move to improve air quality and protect the climate.
